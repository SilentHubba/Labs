For this lab, the code recursively checks each nodeâ€™s children to see if those children follow the properties of a binary search tree. To check whether or not the children follow the properties, the program checks to ensure that the left child is less than its parent node and checks whether the left child is between the minimum and maximum value, decided by its ancestors. The maximum is based on the smallest ancestor that the child is to the left of and the minimum is based on the largest ancestor the child is to the right of. If all of the children follow the properties of BSTs, the function returns true.
