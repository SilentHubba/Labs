Problem 1:
1: n^3 is greater
2: n^2log(n) is greater because n is greater than logn to any power
3: 2^(sqrt(n)) is greater because if you take log base 2 of both sides, you end up with (logn)^2 and sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) is greater than log to any power, 2^(sqrt(n)) is greater.
4: 2^(2n) is greater because it is the same as 4^n, and 4^n is always greater than 2^n when n > 0

Problem 2:
Best Case: Theta(1)
Worst Case: Theta(n)
Average Case: Theta(n)
